finish implementing openai client in cpp and then expose it w/ grpc 

found realy cool openai client lib @ https://github.com/olrea/openai-cpp

need to get that bad boi working and make sure I trust it enough to hand my api keys to it 

also need to determine if we are going with Conan and then drop conan file if not 

I think for project structure I'm just going to go with class folders nested inside of a root level source folder, I'm going to have to determine how the grpc logic is going to fit nicely inside of that
